# Visually disruptive Pomodoros right your tmux panes

***
Had a hard time keeping track of my time (and stopping for breaks!) in my normal TMUX workflow, so I hacked
together a series of commands and scripts to make it very obvious when my time was up.
***

## Quickstart
1. Clone repository
2. Install figlet, and lolcat packages
3. Fits in a small corner window in your workspace.

## Features
1. Easy to read clock
2. Distracting "alarm" when time runs out
3. Runs entirely in a terminal window
4. Filthy Frank
5. Easy to update! (Just change the script yourself!)
6. Simplified! (Doesn't track anything or judge you!)
7. Organic, free range, fair trade, gluten free, carbon-centric 1s and 0s

### Requirements
- [Figlet](http://www.figlet.org): Makes large ASCII art text in a variety of fonts
- [lolcat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat): Adds random rainbow coloring (grabs attention with visual incongruity)
- [Figlet Collossal font](http://www.figlet.org/fontdb_example.cgi?font=colossal.flf) or your choice of alternative
